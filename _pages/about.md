Currently I am working at Flipkart as Data Scientist II in Search Ranking Team where I am applying. I have done my Masters from Dept. of Computer Science Automation(CSA), Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. My area of interests interests are Multi-armed Bandits, Explainable ML, Safe Reinforcement Learning, AutoML and Natural Language Processing. In spare time I love to read non-fiction books, watch documentaries and play music. I am also part of a band names Echoes as Rhythm Guitarist, See them [here](https://www.instagram.com/echoestheband/) :)

#### Update: My work with Prof. Shalabh Bhatnagar titled "Model-based Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning via a Constrained Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm" based on first part of my masters thesis got accepted at NeurIPS 2022. [See here](https://akjayant.github.io/publications/)
